# Code auto-formatting options for clang-format.
#
# Instructions
# ------------
#
# Install clang-format (on Debian Linux: `sudo apt install clang-format`). Open
# a shell and cd to the directory containing this file. To format a file (or
# files), overwritting with the formatted result, run with the `-i` flag:
#
#     clang-format -style=file -i file1.c [file2.c ...]
#
# Or, to check and warn about formatting errors without overwritting, run:
#
#     clang-format -style=file -dry-run -Werror file1.c [file2.c ...]
